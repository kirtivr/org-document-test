* The problem

I want to have a format that I can convert to ~pdf, html~, and maybe
~odt~. The formats I know well are

- LaTeX
- org

One thing I like about org is that it is rather simple, and the
documents look clean. I do not like that it seems to change
constantly and that it is not as universally known as LaTeX.

I want to use:

- links, say [[http://google.com][Google]].
- images, say

  #+caption: A test image
  #+attr_latex: :width 3cm
  #+attr_html: :align center
  [[./clock.png]]
  
  Apparently one has to have a blank line so that the image looks
  OK. Also, with a caption, the image is centered both in LaTeX and
  HTML export.
- code, say
  #+begin_src python
    def test(a):
        """This is just a test
        
        Arguments:
        - `a`: test argument
        """
  #+end_src
- math symbols, say \(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\)
- displayed equations, like:
  \begin{equation}
  a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}
  \end{equation}
- theorems, definitions, etc.
- references, to a bibliographic resource or to another theorem
  previously stated.
- tables, say:

  #+caption: This is a test table
  #+attr_html: :options frame="border"
  | a | b | c |
  |---+---+---|
  | x | y | z |
